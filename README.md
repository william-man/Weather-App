## Project Description

The Weather App project is a React app that allows the user to request and display weather data from the openweathermap.org API.

### Briefing

The requirements this project must satisfy are:

1. To fetch weather data from the  openweathermap.org API.
2. To display the data retrieved.
3. Allow the user to select and search for data specific to their location.
4. (Extra) Display an accompanying weather icon next to the data.

### Challenges

Since it was the first project using a third party API, I needed a way to host the project and hide my API key for secuirty. To solve this issue I decided to host the demo on Heroku that allows the API key to be hidden and stored on their cloud platform.

### Improvements
